The greatest challenge in all of science is to understand how the mysteries of human nature—as reflected in our individual experience of the world—arise from the physical matter of the brain. How do coded signals, sent out by billions of nerve cells in our brain, give rise to consciousness, love, language, and art? How does a fantastically complex web of connections give rise to our sense of identity, to a self that develops as we mature yet stays remarkably constant through our life experiences? These mysteries of the self have preoccupied philosophers for generations.

One approach to solving these mysteries is to reframe the question: What happens to our sense of self when the brain does not function properly, when it is beset by trauma or disease? The resulting fragmentation or loss of our sense of self has been described by physicians and lamented by poets. More recently, neuroscientists have studied how the self comes undone when the brain is under assault. A famous example is Phineas Gage, the nineteenth-century railway worker whose personality changed dramatically after an iron rod pierced the front of his brain. Those who had known him before his injury said simply, “Gage is no longer Gage.”
